OpenCare allows anyone to search for a care service and see how its quality compares
with its peers across Scotland using public data from the [Care
Inspectorate](https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/publications-statistics/44-public/93-datastore). Just navigate to the Dashboard on the drop down menu in the sidebar of this page to begin.
